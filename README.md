## Desription

This repo holds my UCS654 assignments. Each assignment lives in its own folder named by the assignment number and topic.

## Folder layout

- `Assignment-1-Topsis/` — TOPSIS implementation with CLI, PyPI package, and a Streamlit web UI.
- Future assignments will be added as additional folders at this same level.

## How to use

1. Clone the repo or open it in VS Code.
2. Open the assignment folder you want to run.
3. Follow that folder's README for setup and execution steps (e.g., dependency install, running scripts, or starting the web app).

## Notes

- Keep new assignments self-contained inside their own folders.
- Include a README in every assignment folder so instructors can run it easily.
- Use virtual environments per assignment to avoid dependency conflicts.
